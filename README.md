HTML5-Haushaltsbuch
===================

A simple Accounting Application for mobile devices and classical computers.
Based on minimalistic coding in PHP and Javascript to enable simple hosting
at a huge amount of shared hosting providers or other LAMP-Servers.
It's written during watching TV, mostly on weekends but I think this fakt
should not be seen to much at reviewing its code. But I invite everybody to
send me comments on identified deficites.

Caution: This application is based on a strongly simplified view of double-entry 
bookkeeping which should only be used for private purposes. It has deficites
for example in causes of value added tax and is not able to split booking entries.
It is strongly adjusted to my personal needs.
